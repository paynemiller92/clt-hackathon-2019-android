## MedLink Clinics Android App

This Android app provides a user interface for users to find low cost clinics provided by MedLink in the area.

The user can filter on the services provided by the clinic and the fee the clinic charges.

Once the clinic is found, the user can choose to
 - Call the clinics
 - Found out how to the clinic (Walking, Public Transit, or Vehicle)
 - Read more on the clinic's website.

 ### Implementation

 The app was built following modern Android Material Design patterns.

 The app was also built using real data from a real web service.

 Even though it was build very quickly, modern architecture patterns were followed so development could easily be picked back up.
